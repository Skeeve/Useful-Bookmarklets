# FB-annoying

Don't you hate it, when people share cool or motivational pictures
of some useless facebook pages?
I usually block the page of the pictures, not the person sharing it.

But I find it rather cumbersome to click through the process of:

1. blocking them
1. sending fb the message that I find it annoying
1. block again

So I wrote this little bookmarklet.

Simply place it in your bookmark toolbar and the next time you see
such a picture, click the [...]-button in the top right of the post.

Then click the bookmarklet and watch it click through the options
on your behalf.
